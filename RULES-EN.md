# Site rules

All the information on the «Joint Path» web site is intended for private communication of friends, unified by the main common goal: improving the life in our world.

Therefore the web site is not a mass media, even if the communication of friends happens in public space, which is not prohibited by law.

By using this site you confirm that you are a Participant of this company of friends, and you will follow our rules of communication and behavior.

We comply to the laws of our countries.

We communicate politely, with respect to everyone and intention to help each other.

We may quote and link to the information of that information of «Joint Path» web site which is provided in commonly accessible space.

We do not disclose personal data of participants, contents of their personal correspondence and texts of limited availability, unless it's permitted by the author or demanded by laws.

If these rules create inconveniences for us and we want to break them, or we have questions and propositions on improvements for the site, we address its administration:

The site administration is bound to follow the aforementioned rules and keeps the rights to delete texts and to expel participants (temporarily or finally) which violated these rules.

As the resources of human beings are limited, and technical means can be faulty, the site administration does not guarantee impeccable work.

As a help to the administration, we create means of evaluation of texts by the participants; as a result the visibility of texts may be improved or diminished (upping quality texts and downing or removing from the feed low quality texts, etc.)

Propositions to edit site documents can be also directed to GitHub:
