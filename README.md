## Preamble

Obschy (in Russian: _–æ–±—â–∏–π_) means _common_. The key idea of this project is:

**Improve your life by improving the life of all.**

It comes from the realization that:

**Our common path is composed of the paths of everyone.**

Even though we seem to move in space and time individually, our resulting world is created by common efforts.

To create meaningful improvements in our world, we work on our abilities. We are used to think of personal or "spiritual" development as an individual path, or maybe even "lonely path". But in fact we are interconnected, and our abilities depend largely on what kind of world we all create.

Thus, why not work on our abilities together, cooperating and helping each other?

Today people develop the realization that we can grow together, helping each other, regardless of the things that divide us. Regardless of what are our religions, ideologies etc., there can be some areas where we have common aims and wishes. Preserving life on Earth. Learning to live wisely.

## The Platform

Obschy is conceived as a project of common self-development. Its success depends on these three areas:

  * your practice from your own heart;
  * sharing understanding, methods and inspiration;
  * web-based site to connect; to gather, discuss and organize information; to help tracking our research and practice.

Currently two work languages are planned: Russian and English.

### Your Practice from Your Own Heart

Please join us.

Regard your work on this project as your practice from your own heart. Then:

  * it's easy to develop caring attitude, which brings happiness in your life.
  * Success or defeat will not bother you - either of them is just a learning experience.
  * Realizing that ultimately it's the common practice of all beings, you can avoid self-centeredness.

### Sharing Understanding, Methods and Inspiration

We are the people, working here and elsewhere, everyone and for everyone.

We are general public at large, without confessional preferences or discriminations, doing what is possible to help ourselves or others, for the sake of all.

Centering on

  * self-development through awareness,
  * understanding of problems and questions in our daily life,
  * practising the results of those awareness and understanding.

With clear seeing, we could be able to filter out "spiritual garbage" - i.e., low quality approaches - and direct our efforts to the very heart of the matter.

That could efficiently help many people with various life experiences.

### Web-based Site to Connect; to Gather, Discuss and Organize Information; to Help Tracking our Research and Practice

A special mechanism of the web site ("it's own engine", as programmers say) should provide:

  - handy search and structuring information by topics, linking related tasks and concepts.
  - Users could choose the most relevant topics and arrange them on their personal "desktops".
  - We could track our practices and aims;
  - and realize their interrelations.

The functionality should include Wiki (collective gathering and editing of information) and a public "Q & A" engine, so that people could discuss and develop our opportunities.

_(One of the main problems is to provide the quality of discussions by participants, the quality of materials. For example, on fora useful information often drowns in empty chatter, arguments and so on.)_

Thus here are some ideas:

(1) For multifaceted views on problems, "Q & A" format suits better than forum - distinguishing the approaches of every respondent, rather than burying them in between comments.

(2) Voting and straightforward moderation - to highlight the most interesting content and to delete or fold less constructive content into "the cellar".

(3) Guide ourselves and other participants to develop experience rather than opinions.

(4) Focus discussions on the three pillars:

- problem,
- its cognition,
- practices to solve it.

## Technical Information

The web site could be done on PHP7 + MySQL (PDO), though other options could be considered.

## Invitation

If anyone wants to participate - with ideas, materials, working on the web site, anything else - please don't be shy.

It's an "open source" project, public domain, which might be used by everyone for free, and which would be developed by self-organizing community.

No advertisements.

Not for the sake of commercial gains.

Solely for the sake of improvement of your own life through improvement of the life of all.

## Changelog and To Do

  * üíÆ A cheap hosting - found.
  * üíÆ Github repository (for programmers and for general discussion) - [created](https://github.com/chang-zhao/obschy).

**Next:**

  * Register and set up a domain.
  * Open a forum for work discussion, for gathering people, materials, ideas etc.
  * Program and deploy for testing the site functions:
    * Register and login.
    * Show, edit, save texts.
    * Navigate pages, connect and sort them etc.
    * Create personal pages and "desktops" for users; with different settings for public/private info.
    * etc.
